The weather.py code creates a list of random cities throughout out the world. Then uses the openweathermap to identify the current weather
in that specific location. Then creates multiple scatter plots to identify trends among the cities in terms of max temperature,
cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. Then the code seperates the data by northern and southern hemisphere and identifies a
linear regression model of the specific weather patterns.
The vacation.py code then uses this data to identify the best location for vacation as well as the closest hotel to stay in
in that specific city.
