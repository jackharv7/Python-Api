From the data collected from the varying cities located throughout the world one will note that the maximum temperature of a city will decrease as the location of the city moves further and further from the equator. The maximum temperature of the cities located furthest north of the equator have the lowest maximum temperature in the negatives. While the lowest maximum temperature in the southern hemisphere is in the thirties. As the location of the city moves further south the maximum temperature does decrease with only one outlier located at latitude -10, which actual is the lowest maximum temperature of the cities identified in the southern hemisphere. With this it can be said that cities located in the southern hemisphere are much warmer than those located at similar distances from the equator in the north. 
Another trend that can be identified is that cities located further north of the equator tend to have higher humidity levels than those cities located closer to the equator and even further south of the equator. Humidity levels rise as the location of the city gets further and further north of the planet. While cities located on or very close to the equator do have high humidity levels, they are not as high as those cities located in the north and are less frequent throughout.
One last trend that can be seen from the data collected is that the wind speed throughout the world tends to stay consistent  with only noticeable outliers located way north of the equator. With this is can be noted that the location of a city does not have a direct correlation with the wind speed in that location.
